"""
The Jackman Command Line Interface is an internal API only. It is not recommended to talk to the CLI directly.
Instead hook onto functions from core and implement your own commands by creating a Python module that registers
entry points for Jackman.

You can find more information about creating plugins and using the public API in the Jackman documentation.
