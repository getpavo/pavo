# Contributing to Pavo
> At this moment, Pavo is in development. This means that while this contributing guide applies, not all of the contributing rules may be followed in initial development.

The Pavo project is always looking for ideas and new features to improve our service as a simple static site generator. That's why it is our goal to make contributing to Pavo easy and transparent.

## Code of Conduct
This project is currently missing a Code of Conduct, but we will add this once the project gets to later stages.

## Development Process
All changes to the code happen through pull requests. They are the best way to propose changes and are actively welcomed. After review, your pull request can be merged into the Pavo project.

## Commit Messages
We aim to keep our commit messages in line and try to adhere to the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/). Make sure your commit messages look as follows:
1. First include in lowercase the type of commit, followed by a colon. This can be either of the following:
    - `feat` for new features
    - `fix` for bug fixes
    - `docs` for documentation updates
    - `style` for changes that do not directly affect the code
    - `refactor` for refactoring, which neither fixes nor adds
    - `perf` for commits that (aim to) increase performance
    - `test` for adding or updating tests
    - `build` for changes affecting external dependencies using pipenv
    - `ci` for changes to CI configuration files
    - `chore` for other changes that do not modify src/test files
    - `revert` for reverts of a previous commit
    - `enhance` for enhancements that do not add new features
    
2. Then, add a short message (no longer than 90 characters) to describe your change.
3. If needed, add more information to the description of the commit.
4. Commit and push your changes and create a PR when you are happy with what you have made.
